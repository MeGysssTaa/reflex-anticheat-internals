### TL;DR — See [Reflex Wiki][reflex-wiki] first. Having some good anticheating experience will help. Please provide proper attribution if using any Reflex materials and ideas (see [license][license]).

What we publish isn't expected to be easily understood by an unprepared reader. This is more of a set of "recommendations" and "inspirations" for experienced developers of anticheat software, or just for some of you who are way, way too curious *(I'm looking at you, Wronger!)*.

Take everything written within the published materials with a grain of salt. Reflex has never been a flawless anticheat. It's just that we believe that it was a good one. Good enough to inspire some talented members of the cheating and anticheating community, and make hacking in Minecraft harder and less accessible. That being said, please pay attention to all you read and bear in mind that all checks and statements may have issues and serious mistakes. Some parts of the anticheat may even cause the "Why does this .... even work?!" feeling, and that's.. OK, I guess? This is not a "how to create an awesome anticheat" tutorial. This is just something that we believe might have some value for some people.

If you're familiar with the Reflex Anticheat, and perhaps used it on your servers, played with its configuration, and ever talked to the dev team, then you should probably be good to go already. Otherwise, **we encourage you to familiarize with [the official Reflex Wiki][reflex-wiki]** first — it contains a lot of useful information that will not be repeated here, but may sometimes be referenced.

One last thing! To whoever maintains their own anticheats and wants to ~~steal~~ incorporate some ideas we published here in their works, it would be nice if you provided proper credits (attribution) when doing so (a *"btw we used some Reflex Anticheat materials for this"* will do).
