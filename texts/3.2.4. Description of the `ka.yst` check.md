# 3.2.4. Description of the `ka.yst` check

### ⚡️ TL;DR — Use statistical inference based purely on players' yaw (horizontal) head movement in combat. Use AI if you can.

> **From [Reflex Wiki][reflex-wiki]:** Checks for impossible rotations (based on statistics recorded for a period of time).






### Abstract

This check performs more of a "deep" statistical analysis given player's history of yaw (horizontal) head rotations. Note that it purposefully does not analyse pitch because, from what we observed during an unholy amount of testing, vertical head movement provides slightly less value to the detection of Aimbot and, more importantly, a cheater can safely completely turn off their KillAura/Aimbot's pitch rotations to only keep yaw movement, and, in most scenarios, that will work out well (for them, not the anticheat, of course).

By "deep" we mean that a number of statistics needs to be calculated and many comparisons need to be made before making a decision. Simpler checks like just "if variance and skewness big" just don't seem to work in practice (most of the time).

Reflex's Yaw Statistic check has 3 subchecks: short-term, middle-term, and long-term. Each of them seems to be equally efficient and each uses totally different methods to analyze, well, almost similar data — just different pieces and sizes of it. Each of the subchecks excels at its own thing, but combined, they result in a component of Reflex that, given enough time, could detect almost any Aimbot, be that a classic "look-straight-in-head" Aimbot, a smooth AimAssist, a derpy shaky crazy jitter-click simulator with a ton of randomization, or whatever else. We had to "nerf" this check a lot, though, because of those 0.1% players that are able to reproduce false positives every single fight. However, in practice, it's still effective and does a good job at catching what other checks often miss.

Given the names of the three components it's easy, and correct, to assume they operate on different amounts of data, hence the short-term check is the fastest to make its decision, and long-term — the slowest.

The exact raw data is simply yaw rotations (`angle(oldYaw, newYaw)`) collected in combat (and only in combat — that's an important point here!):

1. the short-term aimbot statistic check needs `50` samples,

2. the middle-term aimbot statistic check needs `75` samples, and

3. the long-term aimbot statistic check needs `100` samples.

Given that players usually produce about 15-20 rotations per second on average in active combat, you can estimate how long it will take for each of these checks to make its decision. It's important to note that a single KillAura with the same settings can produce totally different data even when just fighting two different players on the same server. Since the settings/comparisons of the checks (that effectively make the decision: "hacker" or "legit") are "fine-tuned" to tolerate legit players more, these checks are known to have pretty low "recall score" (it may be required to run each of these many times before the cheater is caught), but a pretty good "precision score" (the checks don't falsely accuse legit players in cheating that often).

Patience is your friend here, both when it comes to testing these checks and when it comes to finding "good constants" (thresholds) which the statistics are to be compared against to produce a decision. Our constants were mostly picked by trial and error, and we'll provide them below. But first, read this very worthwhile advice here: AI should do well here.





### MIRA — Using AI can help a lot

These checks were created before we incorporated any sort of machine learning in Reflex, and thus most of the values have been hand-picked (and later, adjusted a lot). But in some of the latest versions of Reflex, we also experimented with **MIRA (Model for In-depth Rotations Analysis)**, which was an ML model to which we were feeding many short-, middle-, and long-term statistics of player's yaw rotations, and which was responsible for the binary classification. Offloading this tricky task of picking the "best" coefficients to a black box **is** actually a good idea, and might help one significantly better results that we at Reflex did with our Yaw Statistic check.

That being said, we had to discontinue our experiments with **MIRA** due to the lack of *time* (again) and training data (gathering of which would also require a ton of data). However, early tests have demonstrated its great capabilities on our testing server, despite the model being severely underfitted.




### What statistics to look at

Now, whether you are analyzing player's aiming data "by hand" as we do in Reflex's Yaw Statistic check, or you feed it to a machine learning model — don't work with raw data, it's borderline useless: both a KillAura fan and a drag-click enjoyer can produce a 360-noscope-headshot rotation and slap an enemy right in the middle of their body, that can't help you make any decision. Instead, use this raw data to collect statistics, such as

- mean (we most often used simple arithmetic mean, but you could probably also try others),

- median,

- difference between mean and median,

- variance,

- skewness,

- kurtosis,

- and various combinations of all of those.

In our Yaw Statistic check, some of the expressions and comparisons actually make sense and can be given a well mathematical justification, while others look like a bunch of random variables combined in a random manner (yet still *they work in practice*). Without further explanation, we'll now just drop what we have and ragequit.





### Short-Term Aimbot Statistic

```java
Statistics stat = describe(smallStorage);

double deltaMeaning = abs(stat.getMean() - stat.getMedian());
double deltaVariance = abs(stat.getHdev() - stat.getVariance());

double ratio = stat.getBalance() / stat.getMedian();
double hvar = abs(stat.getVariance() - stat.getHighest());

if ((smallStorage.sum() != 0)
        && (hvar > 0.1)
        && (!(matchEx(ratio, 0.0575, 0.08)))
        && (!(matchEx(ratio, 0.09, 0.13)))
        && (stat.getBalance() < 0.5025)
        && (!(matchEx(stat.getBalance(), 0.46, 0.485)))
        && (stat.getMedian() < 10.0)
        && (matchEx(stat.getLowest(), 0.5, 1.8))
        && (matchEx(stat.getHighest(), 7.5, 30.0))
        && (matchEx(deltaMeaning, 0.0215, 1.3))
        && (matchEx(stat.getVariance(), 5.0, 38.0))
        && (stat.getAdev() > 2.45)
        && (!(matchIn(stat.getAdev(), 3.05, 3.35)))
        && (stat.getLdev() > 5.6)
        && (matchEx(deltaVariance, 0.4, 2.8))
        && (deltaVariance < 8.5))
{
    result.setMod(100).
           addTag("aimbot (short-term statistic)").
           addTag("s: " + stat.getBalance()).
           addTag("m: " + stat.getMedian()).
           addTag("dm: " + deltaMeaning).
           addTag("dv: " + deltaVariance).
           addTag("a: " + stat.getAdev()).
           addTag("l: " + stat.getLdev()).
           addTag("r: " + ratio);
}
```

### Middle-Term Aimbot Statistic

```java
Statistics stat = describe(mediumStorage);

double mean = stat.getMean();
double var = stat.getVariance();

double sk = stat.getSkewness();
double kt = stat.getKurtosis();

if ((mediumStorage.sum() != 0)
        && ((var > 850)
                || (!(matchEx(sk, -0.525, 6.31)))
                || (!(matchEx(kt, -1.26, 47.5)))))
{
    result.setMod(100).
           addTag("aimbot (middle-term statistic)").
           addTag("m: " + mean).
           addTag("v: " + var).
           addTag("s: " + sk).
           addTag("k: " + kt);
}
```






### Long-Term Aimbot Statistic

```java
Statistics stat = describe(bigStorage);

double sk = stat.getSkewness();
double kt = stat.getKurtosis();

double ldev = stat.getLdev();
double adev = stat.getAdev();

if ((bigStorage.sum() != 0)
        && (((!(matchEx(sk, 0.03, 7.01)))
                || (!(matchEx(kt, -1.19, 60.0)))
                || ((adev < 0.475)
        && (!(matchIn(adev, 0.2, 0.3))))
                || (ldev < 1.225))))
{
    result.setMod(100).
           addTag("aimbot (long-term statistic)").
           addTag("s: " + sk).
           addTag("k: " + kt).
           addTag("a: " + adev).
           addTag("l: " + ldev);
}
```






### The less data you have, the more complicated checks you need

Quite an interesting observation from what you can see from the code snippets above. Well, we all should probably know that statistics only work when we are talking about large quantities. Speaking of which, none of the checks in Reflex rely on any, because that will render it unusable on fast-paced mini-game servers (such as SkyWars).

Again, you should try letting the AI assemble this stuff for you. It's its job to get to know the data and fit it. Although the checks described here work, and often work well, they're hardly maintainable in this shape.
