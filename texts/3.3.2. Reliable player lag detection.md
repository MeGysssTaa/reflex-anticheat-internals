# 3.3.2. Reliable player lag detection

---
### ⚡️ TL;DR — Don't rely on "ping". Monitor delays between client tick (update) packets. Respect recent data more than older data.

> Take a look at **[this page about lag accounting in Reflex][reflex-lag-acc]** — it already contains a lot of useful information which will not be repeated here.






Ping is unreliable, be that "keep-alive-ping" or "transaction-ping" or whatever other kind of pind. Period.

If you want to find out if an online player is really lagging (without the urge to distinguish between connection issues and the user playing on a damn smart fridge), then monitoring tick (update) packet frequency of one's client is your way to go.

Reflex has a nice **Lag Points** system that provides pretty accurate lag accounting, however, it also has some severe drawbacks. I addressed those in another anticheat I've been developing (privately), and below I'll outline the description of one of the "best" lag detection I'm currently aware of. The main problem in Reflex's system is that player's lag was described by a single number — "LP" (Lag Points). And although that's easier to store, it's difficult to interpret and it loses some information in some scenarios. The approach described below uses multiple numbers to describe how much a player is lagging at any given point of time.





### Tick (Update) Packets List

* `PacketType.Play.Client.FLYING`

* `PacketType.Play.Client.POSITION`

* `PacketType.Play.Client.LOOK`

* `PacketType.Play.Client.POSITION_LOOK`

Note that on newer versions of Minecraft, clients usually don't send any of these packets when the player is standing still. This may cause a sense of a player "lagging" when they're simply AFK. Special extra checks have to be made. Bear this in mind.







### Gathering client tick data

Get a "moving window" tick delays list — a list of numeric values (preferably, `double`s) of limited capacity. Every time you get a tick packet from a player, take a look at your clock and write down how much time elapsed since this player has sent their previous tick packet (note that it doesn't have to be exactly the same tick packet). The size of the list should only store the last few seconds, and since the player *"should"* quote-unquote *normally* send about `20` ticks per second, the capacity of your window should be no more than a few tens or hundreds. When the maximum size is reached, just remove the oldest value (from the beginning), shift everything, and insert the new value in the end.

Small performance tip: `Deque` is a much more efficient structure for this kind of task than an ordinary `List`. Take a look at it, Java has an easy-to-use `ArrayDeque` for this, to name one.






### Estimating the "amount of lag" from client tick data

Statistics only work when there's enough data. If your "moving window of tick delays" isn't full yet — don't even try to make any assumptions.

After you've collected enough data, you can start predicting player's "amount of lag". The proposed algorithm might be a little computationally expensive, so it's not recommended to run this update task every time you get a new tick packet from a player. Update their "lag status", say, every 5th tick packet or once a second or so. You get the point.

Now the update operation itself.

First, estimate player's "client TPS" (ticks per second). Again, in a *"perfect"* situation (no lag) this should be around `20.0`. In a terrifyingly bad situation, this should be either `0.0` or `23948293.34` (the player hadn't been sending any ticks for a while, and then shotgun'ed a bunch of them in a row, thanks TCP (why even use this protocol for a game?)). 

Since newer (more recent) tick delays should be more important (to be able to detect lag spikes), it's recommended to use a weighted average here. For example, you can start with a weight of `1.0` for the most recent sample and start computing the weighted average. The second most recent sample would have a weight of something like `1.0 * 0.95`. The next (even older) one would have a weight like `1.0 * (0.95)^2`... Experiment with the actual weight decay momentum (`0.95` in this made up example) to find what works for you. After computing the weighted average of the tick delays `weightedAvgTickDelay`, we can estimate player's local TPS-like number: `weightedAvgTps = 1000.0 / weightedAvgTickDelay`.

The second thing to do is *more lagspike detection*. You see, anticheats are often more error-prone with inconsistent connections than with stable poor/slow connections, so this could sometimes do the trick. For extra lag accounting, compute the standard deviation of the tick delays samples.




### Interpreting that "amount of lag"

We have two numbers as the intermediate output of this algorithm — `weightedAvgTps` and `stdDev`. In an ideal scenario, when the player isn't lagging at all,

1. their `weightedAvgTps` will be approaching `20.0` ("the game is ticking 20 times a second, just as designed"), and

2. their `stdDev` will be approaching `0.0` ("delays between all ticks are very close to 50 milliseconds, and all tick durations are approximately equal (that is, the game takes equal times to compute everything for each game cycle), just as designed").

Based on these rules, you can create custom interpretable "lag statuses", for example, `if 19 <= weightedAvgTps <= 21 and stdDev < 30, then the player isn't lagging`.

### Utilizing a similar approach helps Reflex adjust its checks in an adequate manner for lagging players, while being impossible to fool by cheaters with their tricky "disablers".
