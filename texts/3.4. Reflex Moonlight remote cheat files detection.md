# 3.4. Reflex Moonlight MC 1.8.x remote cheat files detection

---
### ‚ö°Ô∏è TL;DR ‚Äî Abusing old Minecraft's server resource packs mechanism to detect cheat-related files on player's computers from the server side. 
---




> Take a look at **[this page about Moonlight Client Checking][cheat-files-det]** ‚Äî it already contains a lot of useful information which will not be repeated here.





### Overview

Reflex can exploit a security breach in Minecraft's server resource packs system, [that is described here][exploit], to detect particular files related to hacked clients, injectable cheats, X-Ray resource packs, and related files on players' computers. Although the said exploit is often described as "bad", it, honestly, doesn't impose much of a threat for a regular player: it doesn't allow the server to list all files on your system, let alone write or read files on your computer remotely. The exploit works basically because the server can ask any player: *"Have you got this resource pack file [file-name] installed on your PC?"*. And the client will respond. And the problem is, `[file-name]`, in MC 1.8.x, was allowed to contain sequences like `..`, which allows path traversal. For example, a path `C:\minecraft\resourcepacks\..\cheat.jar\` is equal to `C:\minecraft\cheat.jar\`, essentially allowing the server to easily catch the presence of the `cheat.jar` file in this made up case.





### Circumvention and circumvention of circumvention

People, among which were some modders and some cheat developers, created a wide range of mods (both installable and built-in inside their hacked clients) to deny this exploit and prevent the server from doing the described check. However, most of those "blockers" are implemented the "wrong", and Reflex actually also has a check that bans users of such prevention mods. It's incorporated in the `badpcks.rpi` component of Reflex's **BadPackets** check, and it works by counting resource-pack packets sent from the server vs. resource-pack packets received from the client. If the difference starts to grow a lot over time, the player is flagged. 





### Stay silent

If you want to implement this check in your anticheat / on your server, we recommend avoiding scanning players' computers and banning them right on join. This will cause a lof of suspicion from cheaters, and they'll probably find out the reason they got banned pretty quickly. 

What we do in Reflex, and what we recommend you as well, is to start these checks... much later after join. Perhaps, randomly. For example, in Reflex, the process usually begins only after both 1) the player has been online for a random amount of time, from a few tens of seconds to a few minutes, 2) the player is fighting another player for quite some time. Doing so will disturb the vast majority of hackers, and make them believe they were banned for KillAura or something like that. 

Sometimes, exploiting the [security through obscurity][sec_thr_obs] principle helps a lot.






### What files Reflex looks for

Although Reflex is still runnable and you can still use this check, we still believe it's now time to disclose our list of known cheat files. The main reasons are:

1. The list isn't going to be updated anymore anyway by us, but publishing may be a solid starting point for someone who wants to expand it.

2. This isn't a selling point of Reflex anymore because, well, Reflex isn't being sold anymore ;)

3. The check is unreliable, especially for some cheats. In some cases, a dev can update their client to render this list useless. In others, even the players themselves can rename or delete the registered files.

All paths in the list are written relatively to the `.minecraft` folder. That is, Reflex additionally adds a `../` prefix to each of those internally to achieve complete path traversal through the resource pack exploit described above.

Lines inside `/* ... here ... */` and after `// ... here ...` are comments, and are ignored when the list is loaded/parsed on the server.

**That being said, here it is!**
