# 3.2.3. Description of the `ka.ra` check

---
### ⚡️ TL;DR — If they're only smashing their mouse when needed, they're probably cheating.

> **From [Reflex Wiki][reflex-wiki]:** Combines several techniques to detect KillAuras that give cheaters significant advantage.






`"ra"` stands for Range Accuracy check, and that's pretty much the idea of this check. The "several techniques" mentioned on the Wiki are mainly

* calculating where the player would look if they were using a ridiculously blatant Aimbot;

* measuring the offset between that dumb rotation and player's actual rotation;

* measuring the distance between the player and where they slapped their victim;

* tracking clicking patterns and a "special" "improvised" hit/miss ratio.


There's a very good description of the check in the JavaDoc to it, and it also already contains some comments in its code. I'm not going to repeat that here, instead, I'll just post the entire (well, almost) source code file for this check, which is actually one of Reflex's most capable checks (and a surprisingly effective check in the world of anti-killaura in general).

```java
package rip.reflex.check.combat.killaura;

// imports...

/**
 * When approaching an enemy, legit players usually aim and start clicking in advance,
 * thus missing some of their hits due to the target being a little bit out of range.
 * Most KillAuras, even those that "miss" hits when not aimed yet (e.g. LiquidBounce's
 * one), start clicking and hitting exactly when their target is within the configured
 * range. In other words, if a KillAura has aimed at the target once, it will only click
 * (swing arm) at it among with attacking (use entity), without any misses caused by the
 * target being out of range. This check attempts to detect such behavior, thus preventing
 * cheaters from using KillAura with comparably high range settings (3.0 blocks and more).
 *
 * TODO: test with 1.9+ combat.
 *
 * FIXME: if the server is 1.9+, this check will be DISABLED for 1.8 clients because
 *        of a bug in ViaVersion/ViaBackwards/ViaRewind, that delays 1.8's ARM_ANIMATION
 *        packets and thus doesn't let ProtocolLib to catch them and forward them to us.
 *        That is, if the server is 1.9+, Reflex will think that 1.8 clients never swing
 *        their arm. This is NOT OUR BUG.
 *        [UPD] The bug DOES NOT happen with ProtocolSupport, because it DOES NOT delay
 *              ARM_ANIMATION packets. Reflex works fine with ViaVersion + ProtocolSupport,
 *              but not with ViaRewind.

                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return null;
    }
}

```

Key points:

1. If the player isn't looking at their current target, we don't care and don't check them. This is the work of the "if attacking without looking" (RayCast) check.

2. If the target is either too close or too far, we don't care. That produces false positives in short-distance fights or when fighting a lot of fast-moving enemies (fast-switching KillAuras and MultiAuras are the job of other checks).

3. If the player is occasionally desperately smashing their attack button in an attempt to reach their target despite knowing it's slightly out of range, they're probably legit.

4. If the player is consistently knowing "for sure" when to click and when not to, they are probably cheating.

5. If 4 is true and that's happening with very distant attacks or they're looking almost exactly where an Aimbot would, they're almost surely cheating.

This check excels at detecting KillAura and sometimes TriggerBot cheats, at least those that really do give the cheater an unfair advantage in combat (even a slight advantage is enough), and this check is extremely good at it. Note that the Range Accuracy check, however, is incapable of detecting pure AimBot or AimAssist cheats.
