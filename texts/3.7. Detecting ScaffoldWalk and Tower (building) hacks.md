# 3.7. Detecting ScaffoldWalk and Tower (building) hacks

---
### ⚡️ TL;DR — The most reliable way to block Scaffold and Tower hacks is to measure building speed and compare it with thresholds against some of the common building patterns' norms. There are other tricks to detect many cheats much faster.
---




### Abstract

Reflex's `BlockActions` check consists of two components — `blckact.sfd`, which blocks Scaffold(-Walk), and `blckact.tw`, which blocks Tower. It does not check for generic building hacks such as FastPlace or FastBreak.

We'll start with the description of all techniques that Reflex uses to make these checks effective. And we'll finish this page with (almost) entire source code of most parts of the two components.

Note that Reflex's `BadPackets` check also aids a lot in detecting the mentioned hacks quickly by making use of very tricky observations, but these are out of the scope of this page.





### Just measure time

The most straightforward and reliable (although maybe not the easiest) check to implement is the *"how fast this player is building"* check. If players are building their bridge/tower suspiciously quickly, then they're probably cheating. And what exactly should be considered "suspiciously quick" is actually very context-dependent. When we had been doing a lot of testing on big fast-paced building-heavy minigame servers (with game modes like SkyWars and BedWars), we found that, on average, legit players build their bridges with a delay of not less than `5` ticks between each subsequent block placement, both for fully horizontal (straight line) bridges and for diagonal (or somewhat curvy) bridges. As for towering (building straight up), the average delay was found to be above `7.5` ticks.

Of course, there are both "casual" servers with more "nooby" players, who generally build slower, and also "cYbErSpOrT" servers servers with more "pro" players, who sometimes demonstrate absurd building techniques that should really be illegal. Some legit players actually can build even faster than most hackers with ScaffoldWalks. For this reason, Reflex exposes the "min delay" options in [its **advanced configuration** file][advcfg]. And for the same reason, this check isn't a silver bullet for everyone, despite the fact that it's one of the best and most reliable way to block any Scaffold and Tower hack that gives any significant advantage.

The rest of the techniques discussed below are less reliable and often bypassable (although not necessarily easily), but less error-prone (cause less false positives) and detect cheating *much* faster (some — *instantly*).

The time-measuring checks described in this paragraph have the following names in Reflex code (and in Reflex detection/flag logs, such as in `/reflex verbose`):

- for ScaffoldWalk (`blckact.sfd`):
   - building too quickly *horizontally (straight line)*: `type M | d: ... | m: ...`
   - building too quickly *diagonally (curve line)*: `type J | h: ... | m: ...`
- for Tower (`blckact.tw`):
   - building too quickly *vertically (straight line up, Y-axis)*: `t: ...`

Notice that we measure delays in *ticks*. This is for extra safety and as a part of Reflex's lag accounting. The number of ticks passed between block placements is the number of tick (update) packets (`Flying`, `Position`, `Look`, and `PositionLook`) that the server has received from the player between the last block placement and this (new) block placement. This ensures that even if one's connection lags, Reflex will not falsely accuse them in building too quickly, as it would do if we checked something like *"how many milliseconds passed" (recorded on server)*. And this is reliable, too: a hacked client cannot just be spamming tick packets between their fast block placements to fool this check, as this would result in them being detected for using Timer/Speed-hack (which should be detected easily and quickly by any anticheat with good enough movement checks). 





### Check if they're looking at the blocks they're placing (the `type A` check)

When building pretty quickly, after placing a new block for a bridge, player's cursor usually tends to end up being over the newly placed block. If that's not the case most of the time, the player is likely using ScaffoldWalk.

This check also catches the dumbest Scaffold/Tower hacks that do not do any sort of client- or server- side head rotation at all. For example, if a player is staring into the sky while placing blocks below them, they are obviously cheating, and this check will be the one that'll flag them.




### Check if they are moving their cursor too quickly when building (the `dist: ...` check)

Similar to the `type A` check, but inspects player's rotation regardless of their bridge building speed. If, after placing a new block, they are looking very far from the block they just clicked (the "block against"), they are probably cheating.




### Check if the "block against" is valid (the `type B` check)

Some hacks enable placing blocks against air or liquid blocks such as water (which allows hackers to build directly on water). This is always a red sign.




### Check movement speed and block placement timing (the `d: ...` check)

Some Scaffolds place blocks only when the player is already mostly midair (as opposed to more "advanced" Scaffolds that place blocks when the player reaches the edge of their current block). Measure the distance between player's eye location and the newly placed block, and compare it to the distance from player's eye to the "block against". If the distance to tne newly placed block is not big enough compared to the distance to the block that it was placed against, then the player probably hacking.





### Check for "truly" diagonal placement (the `type C` check)

Some Scaffolds allow hackers to place blocks "truly" diagonally while still using the last placed block as the "block against". Consider this fantastic Unicode drawing:

```
    🟥🟩
  🟥🟩
🟥🟩
🟩
```

Imagine this as a bridge that a player diagonally builds on a SkyWars server to get from one island to another. A legit player builds both green and red blocks, because Minecraft just doesn't allow "truly" diagonal placement of new blocks. However, some hackers can skip placing the red blocks, only building the green part. This saves a lot of resources (blocks), but is relatively easily detectable. If neither the player's own current feet Block.X or Block.Z coordinate match those of the newly placed block, then they're probably cheating.





### Check for perfect yaw (the `type D` check)

Reminiscent of [Reflex's **`ka.acr` KillAura check**][check.ka.acr]. Checks the current head rotation instead (instead of difference in current and last rotations). If player's yaw is a multiple of `90` degrees (i.e., exactly `0`, `90`, `180`...), then they're almost certainly using ScaffoldWalk.





### Check for perfect pitch (the `type E` check)

Similar to the `type D` check. If player's pitch is a multiple of `1` degree (i.e., an integer), then they're probbaly using ScaffoldWalk.



### Check for click accuracy (the `type I` check)

Reminiscent of [Reflex's **`ka.ra` KillAura check**][check.ka.ra]. When trying to build quickly, fair players usually smash their mouse as fast as they can. This leads to a large number of "misclicks", or "unnecessary" clicks (clicks at a block without a block place). ScaffoldWalk "know" exactly when to "click", thus having very high accuracy. The faster the player is building their bridge, the stricter is the accuracy threshold that Reflex enforces.

This check only works when players are briding horizontally (in a straight line).




### Check for click speed (the `type K` check)

If the player is clicking too fast (high CPS / low delay between subsequent clicks), then they're probably cheating or using an AutoClicker for easier and safer building.

This check only works when players are briding diagonally (in a curve line).





### Check for compliance with the game protocol

A lot of ScaffoldWalk and Tower cheats can be detected within one single block placement (or sometimes even before that block is placed), or just within the first few blocks, because they do not comply with the Minecraft protocol correctly. There are also some behaviours that the vanilla client *always* exhibits, but hacked clients often *do not*. For this reason, it's often safe to make some assumptions on the packet orders, frequencies, and some other low-level details of the networking part of the game to distinguish between hackers and fair players.

Such tricks are used throughout Reflex, but below we listed some of them which are particularly useful to detect ScaffoldWalk and Tower hacks. Note that some of the the described techniques are actually a part of Reflex's `BadPackets` check or even other checks, not the `BlockActions` check.

- When right-clicking most blocks with most types of items in hand, the legit client sends two packets in a row. First goes the *"try to place a block here"* packet (which is `BLOCK_PLACE` in MC 1.8.x, and `USE_ITEM` since 1.9.x) with (x,y,z) coordinates of the block clicked. Then follows another packet of the same type, with (x,y,z) being set to (-1,-1,-1). Scaffolds/Towers in hacked clients often do not send the second packet (e.g. when using packet switch / server-side item switch (which allows the hacker to build bridges and towers without holding blocks in their hand)).

- The vanilla client never sends redundant repetitive packets. However, many hacked clients may often send

   - two identical `Position`, `Look`, or `PositionLook` packets in a row;

   - two `HeldItemChange` packets in a row;

   - ...

- The vanilla client always chooses the smallest of the available tick (update) packets suitable for the current update. For example, if only angles (yaw, pitch) have changed as the result of the last tick, but the position (x,y,z) did not change, then a legit client will always send a `Look` packet, but never the larger `PosLook` variant. This is not true for some of hacked clients that use packet-level (server-side) rotations for their ScaffoldWalk/Tower modules.

#### Utilities that are used in code snippets above

> **Note.** Here, `Storage` is a class similar to `NumberStorage`, but more generic. Acts as a list of items with limited capacity. A "moving window" to store the most recent data, automatically purging old elements on demand. A `Deque` data structure is efficient here (e.g., see `ArrayDeque` in Java).

```java
    public static boolean isBridging(Player p, Stats stats) {
