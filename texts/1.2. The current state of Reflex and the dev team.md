# 1.2. The current state of Reflex and the dev team

Reflex has been released for free. Anyone can use it on their servers and share it however they like. We're additionally sharing a lot of under-the-hood details so that the developers/maintainers of modern, still alive anticheats can maybe incorporate some ideas in their works. We believe that this way the entire Minecraft community can benefit from what we've been doing for the last few years.

We are not going to continue developing Reflex anymore. Even no critical updates. 

We are not releasing the entire source code, either. There's a number of reasons for that, including the fact that the sources aren't of the "best" quality and may be hard to maintain, and because some of them have been incorporated in the anticheat that I'm privately developing for a server now. Anyway, we've still released what we believe is quite enough for the community to use.

But the team isn't dead right now, and isn't "dying fully" anytime soon. **[Our Discord server][discord]** is still alive, and this repository welcomes any **issues** or **pull requests**. That said, if you believe that the released data is missing something crucial, or you just have general questions or anything to ask about Reflex or us, feel free to let us know, and we'll try to answer soon! This repository isn't exhaustive, and we may be updating it with new publications, if needed. Just tell us what you'd like to see!
