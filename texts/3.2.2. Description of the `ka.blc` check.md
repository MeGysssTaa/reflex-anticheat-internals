# 3.2.2. Description of the `ka.blc` check

### ‚ö°Ô∏è TL;DR ‚Äî If `yawDiff` or `pitchDiff` is a multiple of `0.1` or similar, they are probably cheating.

### "Lazy Aim"

A niche check to detect niche cheats. No clear justification here, just some almost random operations on numbers and comparisons that, during comprehensive testing, were found to "usually work".

First of all, let me introduce what this check even targets. "Ordinary" ("classic") Aimbots provide continuous rotations (head movement). In other words, once turned on, they're always in full control of player's head (or, in case of AimAssists, in partial control). There are more or less "mathematically justified" methods to detect some of the behaviours they exhibit. 

A hacked client by a dev who was extremely popular across Russian-speaking cheaters introduced a way to bypass those methods by mostly "evading" the analysis in the first place. They introduced what we called "Lazy Aim", which is basically a simple Aimbot, but which only works when "needed". So, when the cheater's mouse is far away from their KillAura's current target, their head is quickly moved towards their direction. But when they are already looking at their target (no matter which part of the body), Aimbot just "shuts down". If the cheater isn't moving their mouse at all, then, from server's perspective, they're basically only moving their head once every second or even rarer. This makes most statistical-based (and AI-based) useless when exploited on fast-paced minigame servers (say, SkyWars) since they simply can't collect enough rotations data before the game ends.

Most cheaters don't really understand this, and are still moving their mouse (at least a bit or sometimes) when this "Lazy Aim" in its "paused" state (when their cursor is already over their target). This introduces extra data, but still somewhat inconsistent and random. In my practice, more "classic" statistics-driven checks were failing catching these behaviours even given a lot of time.






### Solution ‚Äî Look for imbalance

Given that with "Lazy Aim", cheater's rotations are randomly driven either by their Aimbot or by themselves, switching back and forth, their rotations will look "imbalanced" or "unstable".

I'll drop the code first, and then try to explain it a little:

```java
    @Override
    public CheckResult check(Player p, Stats stats, Location from, Location to) {
        CheckResult result = new CheckResult();

        double yaw = angle(from.getYaw(), to.getYaw());
        double pitch = angle(from.getPitch(), to.getPitch());

        NumberStorage yaws, pitches;

        if (((yaws = stats.addInCreatedNumberStorage("balYaws", 80, yaw)).isFull())
                && ((pitches = stats.addInCreatedNumberStorage("balPitches", 80, pitch)).isFull())) 
        {
            Statistics ys = describe(yaws);
            Statistics ps = describe(pitches);
            
            double balY = ys.getBalance();
            double balP = ps.getBalance();

            double mY = ys.getMean();
            double mP = ps.getMean();

            double hvarY = abs(ys.getVariance() - ys.getHighest());
            double hvarP = abs(ps.getVariance() - ps.getHighest());

            if ((balY > 1.2) && (balP > 1.2) 
                    && (mY > 1.25) && (mP > 1.25)
                    && (!(matchIn(hvarY, 7.5, 15.0))) && (!(matchIn(hvarP, 7.5, 15.0)))
                    && (abs(hvarY - hvarP) > 0.98))
            {
                result.setMod(100).
                       addTag("improperly balanced head movement").
                       addTag("by: " + balY).
                       addTag("bp: " + balP).
                       addTag("my: " + mY).
                       addTag("mp: " + mP).
                       addTag("hvy: " + hvarY).
                       addTag("hvp: " + hvarP);
            }

            yaws.clear();
            pitches.clear();
        }

        return result;
    }
```

Again, don't try to find much of a mathematically correct method here. Most expressions can likely be simplified a lot to make some sense. 

Here, `balance` is computed as `adev / ldev`, where 

* `adev` is the average of absolute differences between samples of the observed data and its mean,

* `ldev` is the sample of the observed data that is closest to the mean, which is sort of "the most representative element" of the data (note that if data already contains its mean as one of its elements, then `ldev` will be equal to the data's mean, although this is nearly impossible to happen in our context).

"Intuitively", for an average "Lazy Aim" fan, all of the following is (close to) true:

1. `balance` for yaw and pitch is a "big" number. Basically, just some very significant variance (weirdly "normalized").

2. The "means not too small" check is to minimize the number of false positives for some niche cases. Sort of a similar check is present in many of Reflex's checks. It's the legit players' last resort for cases such as when they're fighting in a small room or in a corner, for example.

3. The variance is too small in case the cheater is hardly ever moving their mouse on their own; the variance is high otherwise.

4. Yaw and pitch rotations are very inconsistent. It was observed that nearly any meaningful statistic differs an enormous amount for yaw and pitch.

Feel free to experiment and find better values or expressions.
